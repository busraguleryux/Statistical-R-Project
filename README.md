# Statistical-R-Project
This is the project that I made for my Statistics I course at Hacettepe University. R programming language is used for the analysis of various datasets. 

1ST PART:

The dataset that is analyzed in the 1st step step of assignment is named “Employment, unemployment and participation rates by place of birth and sex” 
from OECD Stat2 ; it is merged with GDP3 and GDP per capita4 of related countries and some adjustments are made. The dataset demonstrates the employment and 
participation rates based on gender and birthplace, but in order to make more specific and purposeful analysis, this dataset’s variables are reduced.
Base-year is 2019 and only the native-born people’s participation in labour force (based on sex) of related country is analyzed. Categorical variable 
“Countries” is shortened into 15: Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, 
Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Turkey. And 5 numerical variables are: Men, Women, Total (Showing participation of men, women and total participation of country, 
respectively), GDP, GDP per capita.

I have merged 3 data tables from OECD Stat and World Bank Open Data. Data in columns related to participation in labour force are from OECD and GDP related 
columns are from The World Bank.

There are 2 questions to be analyzed in this part of assignment:

1. Are men and women participated equally in labour force in different countries?
2. Which one of the following factors is more distinctive to determine a country’s prosperity: GDP or GDP per capita? And what kind of an effect the 
Rate of Total Participation in Labour Force have on this? Does it affect GDP per capita more directly (relatively to other countries in the data list) 
than it does GDP?


2ND PART:

Research question: “What kind of characteristics do students with the higher GPA have?”. The dataset is provided by the professor of the course, Shihomi Ara Aksoy.
It consists of the responses that the students who take the course had given.
